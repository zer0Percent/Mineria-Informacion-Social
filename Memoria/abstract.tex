The nature of the social data brings forward new tasks related to monitoring and analyzing the opinion of certain topics or companies. This requires collect, process and analyze social data in order to determine what type of information could be a candidate for running supervised or unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms. However, social data contain specific features that are not captured by current trained models, as they are trained on well-written texts. Current Machine Learning models must be adapted to capture these social data nuances. It would therefore be useful to conduct an analysis based on the amount of existing data according to these specific characteristics. This could aid to determine which information could be exploited by Machine Learning models and guide future research.
In this work it is proposed three multilingual social datasets and a high level analysis to study how much data exist in function of these nuances. The construction process involves compilation, formatting and considering constraints related to the APIs being used.
